The true mask feels no inside to the mask                             But looks out of the mask by co-masked eyes.                             Whatever consciousness begins the task                             The task's accepted use to sleepness ties.                             Like a child frighted by its mirrored faces,                             Our souls, that children are, being thought-losing,                             Foist otherness upon their seen grimaces                             And get a whole world on their forgot causing;                                     And, when a thought would unmask our soul's masking,                                     Itself goes not unmasked to the unmasking.
