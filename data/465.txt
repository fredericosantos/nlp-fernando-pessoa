Part from the windows the small curtains set


Sight more than light to omit!


Look on the general fields, how bright they lie


Under the broad blue sky,


Cloudless, and the beginning of t1e heat


Does the sight half iil-treat!


The bride hath wakened. Lo! she feels her shaking


Heart better all her waking!


Her breasts are with fear's coldness inward clutched


And more felt on her grown,


That will by hands other than hers be touched


And will find lips sucking their budded crown.


Lo! the thought of the bridegroom's hands already


Feels her about where even her hands are shy,


And her thoughts shrink till they become unready.


She gathers up her body and still doth lie.


She vaguely lets her eyes feel opening.


In a fringed mist each thing


Looms, and the present day is truly clear


But to her sense of fear.


Like a hue, light lies on her lidded sight,


And she half hates the inevitable light.
