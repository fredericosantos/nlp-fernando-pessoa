THE CURTAIN   A curtain hides the mystery  That in the world is known to be,  Mute-horrid as impending thunder,  From eyes unsensual that would see  Behind it things for more than wonder - A curtain past whose living folds  His court of shadows Horror holds.   And he that curtain who shall part  But in his mind, will feel the heart  Grow weak before the irony  That Nothingness pains more the heart  Than things that are or seem to be,  That Nothingness can give a fear,  A sorrow nothing can give here.
