PITY? NO!   Pity? No! I wish not pity.  That were but a bitterer scorn,  Disdain ruthlessly made witty  With a serious look to strain  Its awful joke. No; let me mourn  In peace. Pity me not again!   Pity? No! Let more scorn come,  More indifference, more disdain:  These are the conforts of my home.  To change their look to pity were too far  To make me feel a direr pain.  Pretend not good: it cannot be.  Let evils all seem as they are.  To mask them were a mockery  Heartless and evilly rare.
