There is no peace save where I am not,
The woods are gay where I never pass,
Nothing but shadows are where my thought
Plunges its feet in the moist dead grass.

Nothing save shadows and day elsewhere
Waiting for those that await and hope.
A horror lays its wind on my hair,
And a cold hand does for my cold hand grope.

Yet nothing in me save pain merits this,
Nothing in me save this merits pain.
Oh, Mother of Shadows, whose ice-dead kiss
Is madness, hasten towards my brain!
