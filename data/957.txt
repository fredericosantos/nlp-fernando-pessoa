JUSTICE   There was a land, which I suppose,  Where everyone had a crooked nose;   And the crooked nose that everyone had  In no manner did make him sad.   But in that land a man was born  Whose nose more straight and clean was worn;   And the men of that land with a public hate  Killed the man whose nose was straight.
