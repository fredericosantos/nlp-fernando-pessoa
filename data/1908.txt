THE MAD FIDDLER   Not from the northern road,         Not from the southern way,  First his wild music flowed         Into the village that day.   He suddenly was in the lane,         The people came out to hear,  He suddenly went, and in vain         Their hopes wished him to appear.   His music strange did fret         Each heart to wish 'twas free.  It was not a melody, yet         It was not no melody.   Somewhere far away,         Somewhere far outside  Being forced to live, they         Felt this tune replied.   Replied to that longing         All have in their breasts,  To lost sense belonging         To forgotten quests.   The happy wife now knew         That she had married ill, The glad fond lover grew         Weary of loving still,   The maid and the boy felt glad         That they had dreaming only, The lone hearts that were sad         Felt somewhere less lonely.   In each soul woke the flower         Whose touch leaves earthless dust, The soul's husband's first hour,         The thing completing us,   The shadow that comes to bless         From kissed depths unexpressed, The luminous restlessness         That is better than rest.   As he came, he went.         They felt him but half‑be. Then he was quietly blent         With silence and memory.   Sleep left again their laughter,         Their tranced hope ceased to last, And but a small time after         They knew not he had passed.   Yet when the sorrow of living,         Because life is not willed, Comes back in dreams' hours, giving         A sense of life being chilled,   Suddenly each remembers -         It glows like a coming moon On where their dream‑life embers ­-         The mad fiddler's tune.
