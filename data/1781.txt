Mother, my cheeks are wet. 
        Let down my hair and kiss
My brow. I seem to forget 
        Even if I think of this.

Lullaby to me, mother, 
        Lullaby to me.
I loved and was not loved, mother. 
        Kiss me and let me be.

Let me sleep as of old, thy hand 
        On my brow, so calm and so deep,
That I feel't on my soul, my soul fanned 
        By thy breath on the face of my sleep.

I am but a little ship, mother, 
        Lost out in the sea.
Lullaby to me, mother, 
        Lullaby to me.
